# The English Football Club

The English Football Club's website is to promote their training sessions for children, between the ages of 7-10, living in GÃ¶teborg (Gothenburg), Sweden. The unique selling point of The English Football CLub, is that all training sessions are held in English.

The site is targeted at parents of children who are looking for a sporting activity that will get their children outside and running and participating within teams. The site will display key information about the training sessions, prices, the coaches, and the location of said sessions. The site will also give parents the opportunity to sign their child(ren) up to participate.

  - The sections include, 'Home', 'About Us', 'Coaches and Contact Us', 'Prices', 'Training Times', and 'Sign-Up'. The 'Sign-Up' directs the user to a new page. The navigation bar retains the same position and style on both pages, allowing for good accessibility.

- __Landing Page Image__

 - The landing image is a photograph with a text overlay. This provides the user with instant information,  'what the site is about', 'age range', and 'location of the training sessions'. This allows the user instant clarification regarding the site.
 - This section provides a large football training related photo that is colourful and eye-catching. The image colours also maintain the colour theme of the website. The center piece of the image, shows a nice light blue, with tones of white being the secondary stand-out colour.
 - For mobile devices I opted for the text overlay to have a bold background colour and to sit on top of the landing page image. I chose this design as it felt that this information would be read instantly when the user access the website on a mobile device. It also maintains a visual balance of block text, image, block text etc achieved with the website.

- __Coaches & Contact Us__

  - This is to provide users with a quick look at who the coaches are at The English Football Club. It provides a profile photo, mobile contact, and email address.
  - On tablets and above, there is extra information regarding the coaches. This follows the styling of the 'About Us' section. Quick, bite-sized facts establishing the coaches credentials. Only profile photos, mobile and email contact details are visible for mobile devices. This is to provide the most important information to the user if accessing on a mobile. Also, if a user needs to get in contact with a coach, the information is present without any distracting information.
  - In keeping with the visual design of this website, the background image is zoomed in. Each coach information is separated within their own box stacked on top of each other. The opaque background allows the content to be visible as a text overlay of the image. Again, maintaining visual design patterns.
