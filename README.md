# The English Football Club

The English Football Club's website is to promote their training sessions for children, between the ages of 7-10, living in GÃ¶teborg (Gothenburg), Sweden. The unique selling point of The English Football CLub, is that all training sessions are held in English.

The site is targeted at parents of children who are looking for a sporting activity that will get their children outside and running and participating within teams. The site will display key information about the training sessions, prices, the coaches, and the location of said sessions. The site will also give parents the opportunity to sign their child(ren) up to participate.

## UX and UI Design

The owner of the company tasked me with designing and implementing a colourful, snappy, and to the point website. I agreed that this was best fit for their, and their user needs. The company itself is self-explanatory. They host football training in English for children (company based in Sweden). The website needed to reflect this, and did not need to create an informational overload for the user of the website. The owner required a website to detail prices, locations, and for parents to sign their child(ren) up to join the fun.

With this in mind, it was clear that the website required colourful imagery, bold colouring, and minimal text content. All content had to be 'to the point' and quickly at hand for the user.

### Wireframes

All three of my wireframes are very basic mock-ups. I was concerned with creating the layout, rather than a content. 

I originally drew my mock-ups by hand. I then created a digital mock-up using Balsamiq.

## Design

### Imagery

I sourced my imagery from two different stock image websites, Unsplash and Pexels, respectively. I reduced the file size of my images using TinyPNG, a compression website. I used the .png image file type to maintain a high image quality whilst reducing the size of each individual image file. This will improve the speed and loading times of the website.

I wanted images that best represented football sessions for children between 7 and 10 years old. I wanted to use vibrant images. I wanted fun images. I wanted sunny images. I wanted colourful images. Initially, I opted out of using images that clearly showed the faces of any children. This was a personal ethical preference, as I didn't think it sat right. 

The images collated helped to further present the story of the website. They visually demonstrate a fun and vibrant social gathering for children, where they will take part in football training sessions.

The colours in the imagery helped with the final decision of my colour scheme.

### Colour Scheme

In choosing my colour palette, I used the website ' Coolors.co'.

I wanted colours that had a strong relationship with football teams traditional colours. 

Initially, I could not settle between a red or blue colour pallette. I settled with blue for two reasons. The first being that red is quite a powerful colour. Visually, it can be rather distracting and make the website less accessible for all users. Secondly, a lot of the imagery I used had powerful blue colours, with white being secondary. To help maintain a great visual design I opted for blue.

![Colour Palette](/assests/readme-images/colour-scheme.png/)

I felt that these colours best represented a 'warmer' blue, had they had a strong association with football. These colours provided great visual readability of all aspects of the website. There is a good collection of background colours, text colours, and overlay styled colours.

  - '1B264F'
    - Main background colour. Used for the logo and block backgrounds.
  - '274690'
    - Text overlay colour.
  - '576CA8'
    - Navigation bar colour.
  - 'F5F3F5'
    - Text/font colour. 


### Typography

I used Google Fonts to select my fonts.

![Typography](/assests/readme-images/font-family.png)

I like sleek and minimalist font styles. I narrowed down my search for these style of fonts. The font that instantly stood out was 'Raleway'. I used Google's popular pairings with 'Raleway'. Upon testing each selection, I settled on pairing 'Raleway' with 'Montserrat'.

The two fonts provided a nice and subtle difference. Due to its default font-weight, 'Montserrat' would be fantastic to use for the logo and each heading on the website. 'Raleway', with its slim minimalist feel, would be great to use for the main content of the website.

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Logo__
  
  -The logo is a simple font based logo to keep with a more minimalist and sleek design. The logo also doubles up as a navigational link, to allow the user to always return to the home page.

![Logo](https:/)

- __Navigation Bar__
  
  - The navigation bar is featured on both pages of the website. The main page of the website is a single page website, which the navigation links will help the user    jump down to each specific section. 
  - The sections include, 'Home', 'About Us', 'Coaches and Contact Us', 'Prices', 'Training Times', and 'Sign-Up'. The 'Sign-Up' directs the user to a new page. The navigation bar retains the same position and style on both pages, allowing for good accessibility.

- __Landing Page Image__

  - The landing image is a photograph with a text overlay. This provides the user with instant information,  'what the site is about', 'age range', and 'location of the training sessions'. This allows the user instant clarification regarding the site.
  - This section provides a large football training related photo that is colourful and eye-catching. The image colours also maintain the colour theme of the website. The center piece of the image, shows a nice light blue, with tones of white being the secondary stand-out colour.
  - For mobile devices I opted for the text overlay to have a bold background colour and to sit on top of the landing page image. I chose this design as it felt that this information would be read instantly when the user access the website on a mobile device. It also maintains a visual balance of block text, image, block text etc achieved with the website.

- __About Us__

  - This provides the user with quick facts about The English Football Club. It establishes the success the club already has had allowing a sense of ease for the user.
  - It shows how the club is diverse and inclusive, to help put parents minds at ease.
  - The second is a block background with font. I wanted to keep a minimalist approach, with straight to the point text. Information is clear, concise and can be read easily.

![About Us](https:/)

- __Coaches & Contact Us__

  - This is to provide users with a quick look at who the coaches are at The English Football Club. It provides a profile photo, mobile contact, and email address.
  - On tablets and above, there is extra information regarding the coaches. This follows the styling of the 'About Us' section. Quick, bite-sized facts establishing the coaches credentials. Only profile photos, mobile and email contact details are visible for mobile devices. This is to provide the most important information to the user if accessing on a mobile. Also, if a user needs to get in contact with a coach, the information is present without any distracting information.
  - In keeping with the visual design of this website, the background image is zoomed in. Each coach information is separated within their own box stacked on top of each other. The opaque background allows the content to be visible as a text overlay of the image. Again, maintaining visual design patterns.
