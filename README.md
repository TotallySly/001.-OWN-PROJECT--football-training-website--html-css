# The English Football Club

The English Football Club's website is to promote their training sessions for children, between the ages of 7-10, living in GÃ¶teborg (Gothenburg), Sweden. The unique selling point of The English Football CLub, is that all training sessions are held in English.

The site is targeted at parents of children who are looking for a sporting activity that will get their children outside and running and participating within teams. The site will display key information about the training sessions, prices, the coaches, and the location of said sessions. The site will also give parents the opportunity to sign their child(ren) up to participate.

  - The navigation bar is featured on both pages of the website. The main page of the website is a single page website, which the navigation links will help the user    jump down to each specific section. 
  - The sections include, 'Home', 'About Us', 'Coaches and Contact Us', 'Prices', 'Training Times', and 'Sign-Up'. The 'Sign-Up' directs the user to a new page. The navigation bar retains the same position and style on both pages, allowing for good accessibility.

- __Landing Page Image__

 - The landing image is a photograph with a text overlay. This provides the user with instant information,  'what the site is about', 'age range', and 'location of the training sessions'. This allows the user instant clarification regarding the site.
 - This section provides a large football training related photo that is colourful and eye-catching. The image colours also maintain the colour theme of the website. The center piece of the image, shows a nice light blue, with tones of white being the secondary stand-out colour.
 - For mobile devices I opted for the text overlay to have a bold background colour and to sit on top of the landing page image. I chose this design as it felt that this information would be read instantly when the user access the website on a mobile device. It also maintains a visual balance of block text, image, block text etc achieved with the website.
